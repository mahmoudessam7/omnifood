# Omnifood

A food ordering agency that is designed beautifully to make the ordering proccess easy and smooth.

## Description

This is a theme that is designed with pure CSS without any preprocessor. It was designed originally by my instructor, Jonas Schmedtmann but as a student, I coded it entirely from scratch following Mr. Schmedtmann.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* This project is old and was made without any of the tech know today such as 'Sass', so no dependencies were used.

### Installing

* This project does not need an installation, just make sure you have a browser such as 'Chrome'.

### Executing program

* Go to the project folder.
* Drag the 'index.html' file into your browser.
